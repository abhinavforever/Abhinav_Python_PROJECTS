If you want to run any project ,say day 30 password-manager improved then please follow these steps after you have downloaded the code:
1.Open the 'day 30 password-manager improved' (or whatever project you want to run) in VsCode individually . To do this Right click
on the project> Show more options> Open with Code (if you have VSCODE installed). Just keep in mind to open a project individually 
otherwise when you run it an error will be displayed saying that the related files to that project were not found in the location. 
So basically if you want to run a project just open that single project in any IDE individually instead of opening the whole folder 'PROJECTS'.

THANK YOU AND HAPPY CODING :)
